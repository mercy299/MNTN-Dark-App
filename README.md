# 🏔️ MNTN Dark Page Clone

This is a **replication of the MNTN Dark landing page**, built using just **HTML** and **CSS**. The goal of this project was to practice layout techniques, explore clean visual design, and improve front-end structuring skills using a real-world styled webpage.

## 🛠️ Features

- Dark-themed aesthetic inspired by MNTN’s landing page  
- Responsive layout (if applicable)  
- Hover effects and basic transitions  
- Clean, semantic HTML structure  
- Organized and readable CSS
